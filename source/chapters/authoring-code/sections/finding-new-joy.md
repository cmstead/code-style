I have a project I have an on-again, off-again relationship with, that I started work on about 4 years ago. It's open source and I believe there are probably many people out there cursing my name because there are bugs I haven't had time to fix.

This project started as a way to prove that my favorite editor could be extended to support code refactoring. At the time I knew next to nothing about actually writing software which could interpret and modify code.

I made a mess.

Nothing was tested. It seemed an impossible task to attempt to get tests around the code at all. Without tests, I was afraid to make changes to the code, so everything turned into a giant mess of spaghetti.

But, it worked.

Since the code was hard to work on, and hard to manage, I fell out of love with the project pretty quickly. A few short months and it felt like I was quickly sinking into the quicksand of a project that is destined to fail.

Then I started creating other tools. I learned better ways to break up the code so I could test it. I created a run-time type system I could use to guarantee that function contracts were respected.

As I started working on reassembling my project with these new tools, something happened. I found myself excited about the project again. It wasn't because I got to use new tools. It was actually because I found, once the code actually captured and held context, I could quickly dive into and understand the code, even if I had spend months away from it.

This revelation sent me on a multi-year path which has culminated in the writing of this book.
