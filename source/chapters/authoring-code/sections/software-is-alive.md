/bl-->

All software in a state of active development can be considered a living thing. Active development constantly changes and evolves the internals of our software. This means, no matter how hard we try, things will change beneath us.

Even as things change, it should be a reasonable assumption that we can do things to create a space where we can stand. A raft atop the rising tide, so to speak.

If we don't create safe places to stand as we work, we are liable to sink into the depths of our own code, never to emerge again.

The fact that software is alive is also a boon. This means many mistakes can actually be repaired or improved. Nothing is required to be permanent, and we have the ability to capture what we learn in the code we write.
