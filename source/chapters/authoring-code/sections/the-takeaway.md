If there is one thing I would like my readers to take away from this book, it would be the notion that the source code we write is actually a document for humans. This is not a new idea, and it can be seen written on the face of everything we do.

Grace Hopper, noted as the inventor of the compiler, created a compiler for hand-written documents because she believed that source code can be written in such a way that people can understand it without needing to decipher binary streams.

Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin wrote an entire book about creating source code for people instead of machines.

These two people are not alone in this world. There are millions of programmers in the world today, and of those millions, I feel safe to guess there are thousands actively advocating for better source documents.

I had no desire to sit down and write "Clean Code Part Two." That book exists and it has a lot of valuable information in it. Instead, I want this book to be something each software developer can keep close at hand and use it as a way to guide their hand when they aren't sure what to do next.

There is an old joke, "there are two hard things in computer science: naming, cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors."

I hope to offer some answers for the naming concern. The other two are left as an exercise for the reader.
